  <h2>Welcome</h2>
      <p>Hello! My name is Majella Rajan and I'm a highschool student who loves creating apps and websites. I got into coding in elementary school and have continued to grow my skills through passion projects. One of the projects I'm proud of is building a website called collab4change where people can look at scholarships and extracurrciulars. I've also developed my own personal website which can be seen when searching up my name. Personally I think computer science is very fun and I hope to pursue it in the future, but I'd also like to pursue buisness. I also enjoy reading books and drawing because it is very relaxing.</p>
       <p>My favorite website is <a href="https://www.starbucks.com/" target="_blank">Starbucks</a> because I love Starbucks drinks.</p>
